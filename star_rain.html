                    <p>While volunteering, I came to realize that mainstream therapy for children with autism in Taiwan still relies on traditional means, such as face-to-face instruction and medical treatment.  I felt strongly that alternative learning methods like educational apps should be leveraged, since many kids showed interest in interacting with digital devices.</p>

                            <p> 1. Many kids show interest in interacting with mobile phones and computers.
                           	 <br> 2. Kids often forget or lose their stuff. Thus, the caregivers have to check and remind him/her many times each day.
                                <br> 3. Teaching kids with autism to learn living skills is very exhausted. Parents desire to have effective methods.
                                <br> 4. With proper methods, kids can significantly improve their abilities.
                                <br> 5. Though special education at school provides classes for living skills and social interaction, there is still a huge difference when they face the real world.
                                <br> 6. The autistic symptoms vary widely from one person to the next. It will be suitable if kids can be taught by the one who understands him/her the most. </p>

                            <br> 1. <b style="color: #FF7500;"> Social Interaction Difficulties</b>: There is no fixed pattern for social dysfunction because kids on the autism spectrum are unique with different strengths and need at different ages. Yet, most of them have obvious difficulties in social interaction.
                            <br>2. <b style="color: #FF7500;">Lack of Living Skills</b>: Learning practical skills can be challenging for kids with autism, but is essential for independence (For example, shopping, taking transportation, completing daily chores, house cleaning, doing dishes and cooking).
                            <h2>Shed light on our design directions:</h2>
                            <p>In the beginning, we mainly focus on the problems of social interaction difficulties. After discussing with the doctors, we thought that the social dysfunctions originate from "Stereotypic Behaviors", which is defined as repetitive body movement invariance that serves no social function and makes it hard for kids to engage in skills such as joint attention or social referencing while in the classroom.
                            <br>It is complex to solve the symptoms of stereotypic behaviors due to the medical issues. In addition, our ultimate goal is to help kids and their caregivers reduce daily struggle. As a result, we decided to focus on <b style="color: #FF7500;">how to help autistic children learn various life tasks effectively.</b>

                            <p> According to the journey map, we found that there were two issues: kids with autism lack life skills, and parents grow exhausted from having to repeatedly teach them things. Therefore, we designed for two kinds of users: kids with autism and their parents.
                             <p> Designing a user persona for Eddie Wu and his parents helped us in making informed design decisions as we had the end-users always in mind.</p>

                                    <p> We analyzed 20 existing education apps for kids, including learning the alphabet, math, geometry, draw, and music. There were also a few apps designed for learning life skills, like go shopping and take a bus. However, there were two main problems of existing education tools:
                                    <br> 1. Kids can not connect teaching and gaming contents with the real world.
                           			<br>2.  Children with autism have individual differences. Each one should be taught and treated by distinct methods. It can make sure that kids receive proper supports and reach person-centered needs.

                                                    <p>At first, we designed a prototype and conducted usability tests both for desktop and app. We found that kids with autism were easier to use an app rather than desktop because some kids had muscle weakness when they controlled the mouses. Later, we shifted focus to the usability tests for mobile devices.  </p>
                                                    <p>We conducted fifteen minutes long 1:1 session with 5 kids and 7 parents. After testing, parents did a series of qualitative questions regarding the prototype's interface and functionality. The overall impression was positive and we got insightful feedback. Kids played the games with enthusiastic, and parents loved the features of customizing. The design was able to reduce caregivers' feeling of fatigue when they taught kids repeatedly.  <p> Nevertheless, some parents thought that it won't be attractive for teenagers with autism, and had limited effect. Therefore, it still needs to follow up for a piece of time to value the effect of the design solution and optimize the idea later.

                                                        <p> During the design process, I maintained close connection with the foundation for autistic children and adults in Taiwan, a non-profit organization helping autistic people to deserve a better life. They gave me several feedback based on their professional experience and helped me iterate the design to tackle the real issues. </p>
                                                        <p>Through the process of iteration, I learned how to reach the autistic kidsâ€™ market in the digital world, how to improve a productâ€™s usability, and how to place myself in a userâ€™s shoes objectively and comprehensively. I appreciated to have this opportunity and truely understood their needings and pain points. By solving this trivial stuff happened in their every day, I hope that the Star Rain can eventually provide a better life experience.</p>
