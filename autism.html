                            <h2> Key Finding from Interviews:</h2>
                            <p> 1. Autism kids often forget or lose their stuff and parents need to check or remind him/her many times everyday.
                                <br> 2. It is very wasting time that parents teach autism kids to learn living skills again and again, they hope to find more efficient methods to teach their kids.
                                <br> 3. With correct methods or modes, autism kids can significantly learn and improve the abilities than we expect.
                                <br> 4. Though special education in the school can also assist autism kids to learn living skills and social interaction, but there are still a lot of difference and uncertain variables when they face the real world.
                                <br> 5. Autism have big individual differences, if each kid can be taught by the one who understands him/her most will be the best. </p>

                            <br> 1. <b style="color: #FF7500;"> Social Interation Difficulties</b>: There is no fixed pattern for social dysfunction because kid on the autism spectrum is unique with different strengths and needs at different ages, but it’s almost always one of the major problems of autism kids.
                            <br>2. <b style="color: #FF7500;">Lack of Living Skills</b>: Learning practical skills can be challenging for kids with autism, but is essential for independence (For example: shopping, taking transportation, completing daily chores, housecleaning, doing dishes and cooking). Parents are also worry about whether their kids can cope with real world alone if one day they can not take care of kids anymore.
                            <h2>Shed light on our design directions:</h2>
                            <p>At the beginning, we mainly focus on the problems of social interaction, but after discussing with Proffesor. Tang and doctors, we thought the social dysfunctions originate from "Stereotypic Behaviors", which is defined as repetitive body movement invariance that serves no social function. The social unavailability makes it hard for kids to engage in skills such as joint attention or social referencing while in the classroom.</p>
                            <p>It is complex to solve the symptoms of stereotypic behaviors because it will relate to serious medical issue. More, our original ideal is to help autism kids and their parents reduce pain points they faced everyday. So, <b style="color: #FF7500;">how to improve the living abilities of autism kids will be main issue that we focus on later.</b>

There are also a few apps design for learning life skills, like go shopping and take a bus. As we want to help parents teach autism kids life skills, we find that the mainly two problems of existing education tools are:

                                                    <p>At first, we designed prototype and conducted usablity tests both for desktop and app. We found that autism kids are more easier to use app rather than desktop because some autistm kids have muscle weakness when they control the mouse. Later, we mainly focused on usability tests for app, conducted fifteen minutes long 1:1 session with 5 autism kids and 7 parents. After testing, parents did a series of qualitative questions regarding the prototype system’s interface and functionality. The overall impression was positive. Kids played the games with enthusiastic, and parents commented on the features of customizing game content could help them teach their kids efficiently, also reduce feeling of fatigue that teach kids repeatedly. However, some parents thought it will not be attractive for autism teenagers, and it still needs to follow up for a piece of time to value the effect of design solution.

                                                        <p>I am so thankful to did the project which keep in my mind for a long time. As a UX designer, I learn a couple of valuable lessons with this project. One is that no one solution can entirely solve a serious problem, only a little part of it. The idea of this project is related back to what I saw during the volunteer service in Autism Services Kids Club of NTU. During my design process, I maintained a close contact with foundation for autistic children and adults in Taiwan, a non-profit organization helping autistic children and adults to deserve a better life. They gave me several feedbacks based on their professional experience and help me iterate the design to fit the need in the real world. I think the valuable part of this project is to provide an opportunity for autism and their parents to improve their quality of life. By solving this trivial stuff happens in their every day, I hope it can eventually add on to a better experience.</p>
